# ZenkitSDK
[![Actions Status](https://github.com/SeriesOfUnlikelyExplanations/ZenkitSDK/workflows/Deploy/badge.svg)](https://github.com/SeriesOfUnlikelyExplanations/ZenkitSDK/actions)

An unofficial NodeJs client to interact with the [Zenkit](https://zenkit.com/) api. It's functionality is limited to what I needed for the [Zenkit-Alexa skill](https://www.amazon.com/Onward-Tools-Zenkit-List-Sync/dp/B087C8XQ3T), but I'll be expanding it as I find more usecases - and I accept pull requests! 


It should be fully working otherwise - please open an issue if you have any questions or run into any problems!


## How to use it:
